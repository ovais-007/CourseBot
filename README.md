# CourseBot

## Configuration

Create a `config.json` file in the same directory as `course_hunter.py` with the following format:

```json
{
  "student_id": "YOUR_STUDENT_ID_HASH",
  "username": "YOUR_ROLL_NUMBER",
  "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"
}
```

- `student_id`: Your unique student ID hash (used in the website URLs, e.g., `6497...efc`). You can find this in your portal URLs.
- `username`: Your student roll number (e.g., `2K22/CO/283`)
- `password`: Your university portal password

Replace the values with your actual credentials. Do **not** share your real config file with others.
